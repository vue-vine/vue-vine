# Why Vibe

Vibe is a state management solution for Vue Vine.
Before Vine, you may have known several state management solutions for Vue, such as Pinia, Composable functions, Provide/Inject, etc.

This article from [@alexanderOpalic](<https://alexop.dev/posts/solving-prop-drilling-in-vue/>) compares the pros and cons of these solutions in detail, highly recommended to read.

In Vine, since we have the ability to manage multiple components in a single file, we hope to have a solution that combines the advantages of these solutions to manage states across multiple related components, and also make the editing experience simpler and more convenient, without always having to add and switch files.
