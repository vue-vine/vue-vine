Welcome to join us to exploring another style of writing Vue!

Install Vue Vine ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-vine) in your project:

```bash
pnpm i -D vue-vine
```

Vine provides a Vite plugin and a VSCode extension to offer feature support.

Besides, we also provide some other libraries that you might need during development or configuration, you can learn more details in the next section [Ecosystem](./ecosystem.md).

## Install Vite plugin

Use the plugin in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts [vite.config.ts]
import { VineVitePlugin } from 'vue-vine/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ...Other plugins
    VineVitePlugin()
  ],
})
```

## Create project with CLI

You can gradually integrate Vue Vine into an existing Vue 3 project, but if you want to start a new project, give up SFC, and only use Vue Vine, we also provide a project template for you.

Run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
pnpx create-vue-vine my-vine-project
```

```bash
pnpm i -g create-vue-vine
```

## Use macro types

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vue-vine/macros"]
  }
}
```
