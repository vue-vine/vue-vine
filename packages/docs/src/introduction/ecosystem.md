# Ecosystem

Besides Vite plugin and VSCode extension, Vine also provides some other libraries that you might need.

## ESLint config

Since we defined a new syntax for `.vine.ts`, i.e. the tagged template string as Vue template, we need a custom ESLint parser make ESLint work. if you're curious about the internal implementation, you can check out the [source code](https://github.com/vue-vine/vue-vine/tree/main/packages/eslint-parser). In a shortnut, it will replace the ESTree node of tagged template string with a Vue template root node.

We indeed provide a ESLint config for Vue Vine now, and it's supposed to work with most popular rule presets like `@antfu/eslint-config`, `@sxzz/eslint-config`, etc.

**But style rules are not fully supported yet, we will continue to make it better.**

To configure the custom parser, run the following command to install the package:

```bash
pnpm i -D @vue-vine/eslint-config
```

Then, add the following configuration to your `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import antfu from '@antfu/eslint-config'

// `VueVine()` returns a ESLint flat config
import VueVine from '@vue-vine/eslint-config'

export default antfu(
  {
    // First option is not Linter.FlatConfig,
    // it's a setting for antfu's config itself
  },
  ...VueVine(),
)
```

## TypeScript checker in command line

As we know that Vue provided `vue-tsc` to run TypeScript check for `.vue` files, in order to support Vine, we also provide a similar command `vue-vine-tsc` to check `.vine.ts` files.

**To be noticed:** `vue-vine-tsc` is compatible with `vue-tsc`, so you can also use it to check `.vue` files.

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm i -D vue-vine-tsc
```

Then, you may replace the `vue-tsc -b && ...` command in `"build"` script of `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "build": "vue-tsc -b && vite build",
+    "build": "vue-vine-tsc -b && vite build",
  }
}
```

## Project starter template

You're able to progressively integrate Vue Vine in existing Vue 3 projects, but if you want to start a new project, abandon SFC and just using Vue Vine, we provide a project starter template for you.

**(Optional)** Install the CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm i -g create-vue-vine
```

Then, run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
# If you didn't install the CLI globally
pnpx create-vue-vine my-vine-project

# If you installed the CLI globally
create-vue-vine my-vine-project
```

You may seen the following output:

```text
> pnpx create-vue-vine my-vine-project

## Common issues

### Conflict with UnoCSS Attribute Mode

Because Vue Vine's template type checking enabled the strict mode of Vue language tools, so it is not allowed to use arbitrary attributes on the HTML tags in the template. This will affect the scenario of using UnoCSS Attribute Mode. To solve this problem, please add a `shims.d.ts` file to the project `tsconfig.json` (the `include` option) and write the following content:

```ts
declare module 'vue' {
  interface HTMLAttributes {
    [key: string]: any
  }
}

export {}
```
