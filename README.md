# Vue Vine

[中文 README](./README-CN.md)

Another style of writing Vue components.

## Why this ?

There are many discussions in community that hopes for a solution that supports writing multiple Vue components in a single file. That's why Vue Vine was born.

Vue vine was designed to provide more flexibility of managing Vue components. It's not a replacement of Vue SFC, but a parallel solution.
